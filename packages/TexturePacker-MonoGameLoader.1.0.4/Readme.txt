Using a sprite sheet (or texture atlas) increases your game's performance while also reducing 
the amount of memory.

This library includes a loader and sprite renderer
to load animations and sprites from a sprite sheet created with TexturePacker.

A tutorial with full source code about how to create sprite sheets is available from
https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/tutorials/how-to-create-sprite-sheets-and-animations-with-monogame

The tutorial contains additional modules like an animation manager for simple playback of animated sprites.
